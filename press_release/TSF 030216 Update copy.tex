\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{TEVA} \par
We will be taking a position in the pharmaceutical company Teva, which has added more overall risk to this portfolio group.  However, from an overall portfolio view, we see Teva as another piece to our growth opportunities of the overall portfolio.  We will closely monitor this position as it is involved with the souring Allegran-Pfizer deal.  

\item \textbf{ORCL} \par
After our purchase of AT\&T, the TMT group pitched a riskier play in cloud computing with Oracle.  We are confident that Oracle can provide some mid-term upside, and we are comfortable taking this risk due to the elimination of our small cap semiconductor ETF.  

\item  \textbf{TMT Group} \par
With the purchase of AT\&T, we are beginning to scale back on the TMT ETF's. As stated above, we have liquidated our Semiconductors ETF (\$PSI) and will sell our Telecom ETF (\$VOX) at 10\% gain.  We will still maintain exposure to our Media ETF as the semester comes to a close.

%\item \textbf{Healthcare} \par
%Sticking with the theme of ``investors have preferred value over growth,'' our value healthcare plays have shown double digit positive returns vs the S\&P while our growth segment has shown double digit losses.  We will be looking at these positions further in the coming weeks. 

%\item \textbf{Dave's Trade} Smith and Wesson.  Company has considerably outperformed YTD, gun sales are record high in this election year and and I see no reason to see this trend slow.

\end{enumerate}
We have seen an impressive turnaround in many of our positions in the previous weeks.  Leaders include Gilead and Corning, both up almost 10\% in the past month. From our last update, Phillips 66 has also shown some strength recently, while Marathon has continued to lag.  We see that our Utilities and Telecom exposure (in ETF and stocks) has provided us with the majority of our returns, while Consumer Discretionary has also felt the effects of fearful investors. \par As the semester comes to a close, we will be reevaluating our ETF exposure and will be considering alternative asset  classes as a volatility hedge for the summer. As always, feel free to reach out to me regarding our positions and strategies.

Thank you, \par
Research, Risk and Strategy
